                                            <p style="font-size:12px">The Council for the Welfare of Children (CWC) and World Vision Development Foundation led the Forum in observance of the Child Sexual Abuse Awareness Week (CSAAW) marked every second week of February through Presidential Proclamation No. 731 series of 1996.For 2018, CSAAW is observed from February 11-17 with the continuing three-year theme “We are the Solution.”According to the 2015 National Baseline Study on Violence Against Children (NBS-VAC), 2 in 5 children have experienced cyberviolence, either through the internet or cellphone. The data show a timely and relevant issue concerning technological risks and online behavior.Technology, being easily accessible to everyone, brings several advantages and disadvantages.“[Technology] increases the vulnerability of a child, coupled with risky online and offline behavior and lack of supervision when using the internet. It exposes children to online sexual solicitation and grooming,” said CWC Executive Director Mitch Cajayon-Uy in her opening message to the participants.The Forum tackled presentations from Ms. Ruth Limson-Marayag of CWC, Ms. Jezreel Domingo of World Vision, Ms. Gennalyn Macalinao of the Department of Information and Communications Technology and Mr. Edgar Marshall Brinas of DepEd on child rights orientation and NBS-VAC results, online sexual exploitation of children (OSEC), managing online risks and online safety tips, social media security and the Cybersafe Project, respectively.Essentially, the forum highlighted reporting mechanism and hotlines to help and protect the children in case they experience any form of violence or cybercrimes.Selected students capped-off the event with their visit to the OSEC Experiential Booth where it featured a simulated software used to lure children on trafficking and exploitation. The booth was manned by registered social workers to debrief the students regarding their experience inside the booth.</p">
